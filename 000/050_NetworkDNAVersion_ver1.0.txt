NetworkDNA is the name associated to a single consolidation or packing of individual templates.
This document will bring together all of the templates that existed and were grouped together under a single common Library.


This document was put in place to help with long term evolution of the methodology and implementation of network documentation. As changes are made to NetworkDNA, you may not need to apply them if your environment does not utilize that aspect of documentation. 
With each year that passes, the annual review of your documentation provides the ideal opportunity to implement any new elements and bring your binders up to date. This will be compounded with a compliance certificate that will validate your documentation as being credible. Network Documentation is only useful if it is kept up to date.
