This one page document is in tented to introduce you to the purpose and value of documentation with the NetworkDNA methodology. NetworkDNA is an open source effort, taking advantage of the public communities to create a single common manner for documenting any complete computing environment. For more information about NetworkDNA go to HYPERLINK "http://www.networkdna.org/"www.networkdna.org. Additionally, you can follow the creator, Don Krause, through ongoing efforts of the project in a blog at HYPERLINK "http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/networking/documentation"http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/networking/documentation.

NetworkDNA is the organized framework (skeletal structure) for putting information about your network together. It takes the evolutionary process of the network and brings all the hardware software and configuration file specifics together. The end result of such a tool would be efficient recovery from a disaster, establishing productivity of end users and putting the valuable data back to work.

NetworkDNA was designed to be a scalable solution for networks of 5 to 5000 devices. It is for organizations that consist of a single or multiple locations. Additionally it adheres to redundancy practices to prevent data loss in the event of a disaster.

Documentation is the process of collecting and maintaining information. NetworkDNA establishes guidelines for the type and quantity of information to collect. Documentation does not have to be generated by a proprietary inventory application, It can be as simple as a word processing document that details your equipment. Additionally, documentation can be printouts of configuration files, screen shots of hardware configuration pages, TIDS (technical information documents), HOWTO's, License certificates, etc.

NetworkDNA breaks an organization down into locations. Each location is required to be individually documented when it reaches a threshold. Each location that is documented must have a redundant copy of it's NetworkDNA binder. The IT office or a service provider will keep a complete library of all locations to ensure availability in the event of a disaster and to provide service for the environment as a whole.

NetworkDNA will be licensed under the GNU General Public License & Free Documentation License. All files will be free to use, modify, and give away. All documents will be copylefted to ensure there freeness is maintained forever. You are not allowed to claim ownership of or sell the files. To clarify, documentation provided as a value added service can generate revenue. The original distributed files can not be password protected, marked read only, or modified in a way that prevents another from achieving value with them. 

NetworkDNA is a project that will continue to evolve.  If you find any element of the methodology or the template files to be questionable, or lacking... please share your thoughts with the community that is dedicated to establishing a world wide documenting practice.
