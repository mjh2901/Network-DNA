The objective of using model assignments is to create a documenting practice that will allow us to establish the document once use many (DOUM) process.

It is possible for a single organization that consists of multiple locations to have similar devices in many of the locations. We are trying to prevent duplication of efforts across locations.

A long term goal is to get the manufacturers to help in our document implementations by providing the model information for us to incorporate into the WikiDNA binder or database. This would aleviate the administrator or service provider from having to perform that task. All they would have to do is associate the model to a device in the device list, and note any deviations from the manufacturer's defaults for that model or part number.
